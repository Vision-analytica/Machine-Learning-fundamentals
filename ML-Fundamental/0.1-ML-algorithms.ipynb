    "\n",
    "- Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well \"labelled\" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.\n",
    "- In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machines work as the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. It applies the same concept as a student learns in the supervision of the teacher.\n",

    "## 2. Unsupervised Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is another type of machine learning in which the computer is trained on unlabeled data, meaning the data does not have any pre-existing labels or targets. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find hidden patterns or structure in the data without the guidance of a labeled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are working with a dataset of customer purchase histories for a retail store, and you want to identify groups or clusters of customers who have similar purchase patterns. Since the dataset does not have any pre-defined labels or categories, you would use an unsupervised learning algorithm, such as k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering, to group the customers based on their purchase histories. The algorithm would analyze the input features (such as purchase frequency, amount spent, and product categories) to discover patterns or similarities in the data, and then group the customers into different clusters based on these patterns. Once the clustering is complete, you can use it to identify different customer segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Unsupervised Learning works?\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised using training dataset. Instead, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the human brain while learning new things. Unlike supervised learning, where the data is labeled with a target variable, unsupervised learning algorithms work on unlabeled data.\n",

    "- **Data preparation:** The first step is to prepare the data for analysis. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and scaling the features as needed.\n",
    "- **Choosing an algorithm:** Next, you choose an unsupervised learning algorithm that is appropriate for your data and task. There are several types of unsupervised learning algorithms, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule mining.\n",
    "- **Training the model:** The next step is to train the unsupervised learning model on the data. During training, the model will analyze the patterns and structure in the data to identify relationships and groupings.\n",
    "- **Model evaluation:** Unlike supervised learning, there is no clear metric for evaluating the performance of unsupervised learning algorithms. Instead, you must manually inspect the results to determine if they make sense and align with your domain knowledge.\n",
    "- **Applying the model:** Once you have trained and evaluated the model, you can apply it to new, unseen data to make predictions or uncover hidden patterns.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn through trial and error by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for the actions it takes in the environment. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the total reward it receives over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL, the agent learns by exploring the environment, taking actions, receiving rewards, and updating its policy based on the feedback it receives. The agent’s policy is a mapping from states to actions that maximizes the expected future reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Examples for Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are training an agent to play a game of chess. The agent interacts with the game board and makes moves based on the current state of the game. The goal is for the agent to learn to make moves that lead to a win, while avoiding moves that lead to a loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, the agent receives a reward signal based on the outcome of each move it makes. For example, the agent might receive a positive reward for making a winning move, or a negative reward for making a losing move. The agent uses this feedback to adjust its strategy and make better moves in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the agent, you would use a reinforcement learning algorithm such as Q-learning or policy gradient methods. These algorithms learn to optimize the agent's behavior by maximizing the expected cumulative reward over time. As the agent interacts with the game board and receives feedback, it gradually learns which moves are more likely to lead to a win and adjusts its strategy accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the agent should become better and better at playing chess, as it learns from its experiences and improves its decision-making. Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including robotics, game playing, and autonomous driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components in RL\n",
    "There are several components in RL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Environment:** The environment is the external world with which the agent interacts. The agent receives observations of the environment, takes actions based on those observations, and receives rewards or penalties as feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Agent:** The agent is the entity that interacts with the environment. It selects actions based on its current policy, which is updated based on the rewards it receives.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reward Function:** The reward function defines the goal of the agent. It maps states and actions to rewards or penalties. The agent tries to maximize the cumulative reward it receives over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Policy:** The policy is the mapping from states to actions. The agent learns the policy through trial and error, and updates it based on the rewards it receives.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Value Function:** The value function estimates the expected cumulative reward that the agent will receive if it follows a particular policy.\n",

    "In building ML applications, datasets are divided into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training dataset:**  The part of data we use to train our model. This is the data that your model actually sees(both input and output) and learns from.\n",
    "- **Validation Data:** The part of data that is used to do a frequent evaluation of the model, fit on the training dataset along with improving involved hyperparameters (initially set parameters before the model begins learning). This data plays its part when the model is actually training.\n",
    "- **Test Dataset:** Once our model is completely trained, testing data provides an unbiased evaluation. When we feed in the inputs of Testing data, our model will predict some values(without seeing actual output). After prediction, we evaluate our model by comparing it with the actual output present in the testing data. This is how we evaluate and see how much our model has learned from the experiences feed in as training data, set at the time of training.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you’re working for a car manufacturing company and you want to build a model that can predict the fuel efficiency of a car based on the weight and the engine size. In this case, the target variable (or label) is the fuel efficiency, and the features (or input variables) are the weight and engine size. You will collect data from different car models, with corresponding weight and engine size, and their fuel efficiency. This data is labeled and it’s in the form of (weight,engine size,fuel efficiency) for each car. After having your data ready, you will then split it into two sets: training set and testing set, the training set will be used to train the model and the testing set will be used to evaluate the performance of the model. Preprocessing could be needed for example, to fill missing values or handle outliers that might affect your model accuracy.\n",

    "### Types of data in datasets\n",
    "- **Numerical data:** Such as house price, temperature, etc.\n",
    "- **Categorical data:** Such as Yes/No, True/False, Blue/green, etc.\n",
    "- **Ordinal data:** These data are similar to categorical data but can be measured on the basis of comparison.\n",
