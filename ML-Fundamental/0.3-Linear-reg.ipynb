    "# Introduction to Linear Regression in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a popular and widely used algorithm in machine learning for predicting continuous numeric values. It models the relationship between independent variables (input features) and a dependent variable (target variable) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. In this section, we will provide a brief overview of linear regression, including the mathematical explanation and figures to aid understanding.\n",

    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression (SLR) is a statistical model that focuses on the relationship between a single independent variable (or feature) and an outcome variable. In SLR, the functional relationship between the outcome variable and the regression coefficient is linear. This means that the mathematical function describing the relationship is a straight line and the impact of the independent variable on the outcome is represented by a linear regression coefficient.\n",

    "## Steps in building a regression model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STEP 1: Collect/Extract Data:** The first step in building a regression model is to collect or extract data on the dependent (outcome) variable and independent (feature) variables from different data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STEP 2: Pre-Process the Data:** Before the model is built, it is essential to ensure the quality of the data for issues such as reliability, com- pleteness, usefulness, accuracy, missing data, and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Data imputation techniques may be used to deal with missing data. Use of descriptive statistics and visualization (such as box plot and scatter plot) may be used to identify the existence of outliers and variability in the dataset.\n",
    "    - Many new variables (such as the ratio of variables or product of variables) can be derived (aka feature engineering) and also used in model building.\n",
    "    - Categorical data must be pre-processed using dummy variables as a part of feature engineering, prior to utilizing it in a regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STEP 3: Dividing Data into Training and Validation Datasets:** In this stage the data is divided into two subsets (sometimes more than two subsets):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - training dataset and\n",
    "    - validation or test dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The proportion of training dataset is usually between 70% and 80% of the data and the remaining data is treated as the validation data. The subsets may be created using random/ stratified sampling procedure. This is an important step to measure the performance of the model using dataset not used in model building. It is also essential to check for any overfitting of the model. In many cases, multiple training and multiple test data are used (called cross-validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STEP 4: Perform Descriptive Analytics or Data Exploration:** It is always a good practice to perform descriptive analytics before moving to building a predictive analytics model. Descriptive statistics will help us to understand the variability in the model and visualization of the data through, say, a box plot which will show if there are any outliers in the data. Another visualization technique, the scatter plot, may also reveal if there is any obvious relationship between the two variables under consideration. Scatter plot is useful to describe the functional relationship between the dependent or outcome variable and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STEP 5: Build the Model:** The model is built using the training dataset to estimate the regression parameters. The method of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is used to estimate the regression parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STEP 6: Perform Model Diagnostics:** Regression is often misused since many times the modeler fails to perform necessary diagnostics tests before applying the model. Before it can be applied, it is necessary that the model created is validated for all model assumptions including the definition of the function form. If the model assumptions are violated, then the modeler must use remedial measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STEP 7: Validate the Model and Measure Model Accuracy:** A major concern in analytics is over-fitting, that is, the model may perform very well on the training dataset, but may perform badly in validation dataset. It is important to ensure that the model perfor- mance is consistent on the validation dataset as is in the training dataset. In fact, the model may be cross- validated using multiple training and test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STEP 8: Decide on Model Deployment:** The final step in the regression model is to develop a deployment strategy in the form of actionable items and business rules that can be used by the organization."
