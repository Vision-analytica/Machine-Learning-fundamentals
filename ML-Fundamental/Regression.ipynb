    "Regression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more independent variables. More specifically, Regression analysis helps us to understand how the value of the dependent variable is changing corresponding to an independent variable when other independent variables are held fixed.\n",

    "The goal of regression is to find a mathematical relationship between the input features and the target variable that can be used to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data."
