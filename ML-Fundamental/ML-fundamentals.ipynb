    "## Analytics\n",
    "Analytics is a collection of techniques and tools used for creating value from data. Techniques include concepts such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms.\n",

    "- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Algorithms and systems that exhibit human-like intelligence.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning (ML):** Subset of AI that can learn to perform a task with extracted data and/or\n",

    "Machine learning is a set of algorithms that have the capability to learn to perform tasks such as prediction and classification effectively using data.\n",

    "## Categories of ML algorithms\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning Algorithms:** These algorithms require the knowledge of both the outcome variable (dependent variable) and the features (independent variable or input variables). The algorithm learns (i.e., estimates the values of the model parameters or feature weights) by defining a loss function which is usually a function of the difference between the predicted value and actual value of the outcome variable\n",
    "2.\t**Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:** These algorithms are set of algorithms, which do not have the knowledge of the outcome variable in the dataset. The algorithms must find the possible values of the outcome variable.\n",
    "3.\t**Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:** In many datasets, there could be uncertainty around\n",
    "both input as well as the output variables. For example, consider the case of spell check in various text editors. If a person types “buutiful” in Microsoft Word, the spell check in Microsoft Word will immediately identify this as a spelling mistake and give options such as “beautiful”, “bountiful”, and dutiful”. Here the prediction is not one single value, but a set of values.\n",
    "4.\t**Evolutionary Learning Algorithms:** Evolutional algorithms are algorithms that imitate natural evolution to solve a problem. Techniques such as genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization fall under the category of evolutionary learning algorithms.\n",

    "## A typical ML algorithm uses the following steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the problem or opportunity for value creation.\n",
    "2. Identify sources of data (primary as well secondary data sources) and create a data lake\n",
    "(integrated data set from different sources).\n",
    "3. Pre-process the data for issues such as missing and incorrect data. Generate derived variables\n",
    "(feature engineering) and transform the data if necessary. Prepare the data for ML model building.\n",
    "4. Divide the datasets into subsets of training and validation datasets.\n",
    "5. Build ML models and identify the best model(s) using model performance in validation data.\n",
    "6. Implement Solution/Decision/Develop Product.\n",
