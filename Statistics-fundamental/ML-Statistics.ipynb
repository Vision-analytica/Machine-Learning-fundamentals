    "* A large variance means that the numbers in a set are far from the mean and each other. A small variance means that the numbers are closer together in value.\n",

    "* **Disadvantage:** One of the most commonly discussed disadvantages of variance is that it gives added weight to numbers that are far from the mean, or outliers. Squaring these numbers can at times result in skewed interpretations of the data set as a whole.\n",

    "The standard deviation, denoted œÉ, is the positive square root of the variance., i.e. $\\sigma= \\sqrt{Var(x)}$.

    "#### Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Covariance provides insight into how two variables are related to one another.\n",
    "* More precisely, covariance refers to the measure of how two random variables in a data set will change together.\n",
    "* A positive covariance means that the two variables at hand are positively related, and they move in the same direction.\n",

    "In this formula, $X$ represents the independent variable, $Y$ represents the dependent variable, $N$ represents the number of data points in the sample, $\\bar{x}$ represents the mean of the $X$, and $\\bar{y}$ represents the mean of the dependent variable $Y$. Note that while calculating a sample variance in order to estimate a population variance, the denominator of the variance equation becomes N ‚Äì 1. This removes bias from the estimation.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Covariance and correlation both primarily assess the relationship between variables.\n",
    "* The closest analogy to the relationship between them is the relationship between the variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "* Covariance measures the total variation of two random variables from their expected values. Using covariance, we can only gauge the direction of the relationship (whether the variables tend to move in tandem or show an inverse relationship). However, it does not indicate the strength of the relationship, nor the dependency between the variables.\n",
    "* On the other hand, correlation measures the strength of the relationship between variables. Correlation is the scaled measure of covariance. It is dimensionless. In other words, the correlation coefficient is always a pure value and not measured in any units.\n",

    "    1. Covariance can take on practically any number while a correlation is limited: -1 to +1.\n",
    "    2. Because of its numerical limitations, correlation is more useful for determining how strong the relationship is between the two variables.\n",
    "    3. Correlation does not have units. Covariance always has units.\n",

    "## Central Limit theorem (CLT): \n",
    "\n",
    "In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of a sample variable approximates a normal distribution (i.e., a ‚Äúbell curve‚Äù) as the sample size becomes larger, assuming that all samples are identical in size, and regardless of the population's actual distribution shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample sizes equal to or greater than 30 are often considered sufficient for the CLT to hold. CLT is useful in finance when analysing a large collection of securities to estimate portfolio distributions and traits for returns, risk, and correlation.\n",
    "- According to the central limit theorem, the mean of a sample of data will be closer to the mean of the overall population in question, as the sample size increases, notwithstanding the actual distribution of the data. In other words, the data is accurate whether the distribution is normal or aberrant.\n",
    "- Key component of CLT is:\n",
    "    * Sampling is successive,\n",
    "    * Sampling is random,\n",
    "    * Samples should be independent,\n",
    "    * Samples should be limited,\n",
    "    * Sample size is increasing.\n",
    "- A Central Limit Theorem word problem will most likely contain the phrase ‚Äúassume the variable is normally distributed‚Äù, or one like it."
