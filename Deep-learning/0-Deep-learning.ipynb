    "## Definition\n",
    "Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves the use of artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and solve complex problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common classifications of deep learning include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feedforward neural networks:** These are neural networks that have a series of interconnected layers, where the output of each layer serves as the input for the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convolutional neural networks (CNNs):** These are neural networks that are particularly suited to image and video analysis tasks. They use a type of neural network layer called a convolutional layer that can extract features from images or video frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recurrent neural networks (RNNs):** These are neural networks that are well-suited to sequence analysis tasks, such as natural language processing or speech recognition. They use a type of neural network layer called a recurrent layer that can maintain an internal state and process inputs one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generative adversarial networks (GANs):** These are neural networks that can generate new data that is similar to a training set. GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator network that creates new data, and a discriminator network that tries to distinguish between the generated data and real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Autoencoders:** These are neural networks that are used for unsupervised learning tasks. They are designed to encode an input into a lower-dimensional representation and then decode it back into the original input. Autoencoders can be used for tasks such as image compression or anomaly detection."
