    "**(Multiple Linear Regression)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple  linear  regression  (MLR)  is  a  supervised  learning  algorithm  for  finding  the  existence  of  an  association relationship between a dependent variable (aka response variable or outcome variable) and several independent variables (aka explanatory variables or predictor variable or features).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The functional form of MLR is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $Y_i =  \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{1i} + \\beta_2 X_{2i} + .... + + \\beta_k X_{ki} + \\epsilon_{ki}$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\beta_1$,  $\\beta_2$, $\\beta_3$, .... , $\\beta_k$ are partial regression coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - X = independent variables (aka explanatory variables or predictor variable or features)\n",
    "    - Y = dependent variable (aka response variable or outcome variable)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the relationship between an explanatory variable and the response (outcome) variable is calculated after removing (or controlling) the effect all the other explanatory variables (features) in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The assumptions that are made in multiple linear regression model are as follows:\n",
    "    1. **Linearity:** The regression model is linear in regression parameters (b-values).\n",
    "    2. **Normal distribution:** The residuals follow a normal distribution and the expected value (mean) of the residuals is zero.\n",
    "    3. **Uncorrelated residuals:** In time series data, residuals are assumed to uncorrelated.\n",
    "    4. **Variance of the residuals** The variance of the residuals is constant for all values of $X_i$. When the variance of the residuals is constant for different values of $X_i$, it is called homoscedasticity. A non-constant variance of residuals is called heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "    5. **Correlation between independent variables:** There is no high correlation between independent variables in the model (called multi-collinearity). Multi-collinearity can destabilize the model and can result in an incorrect estimation of the regression parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The partial regressions coefficients are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE)."

    "\n",
    "The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional league for Twenty20 (T20) cricket championships that  was started in 2008 in India. IPL was initiated by the BCCI with eight franchises comprising players from  across  the  world.  The  first  IPL  auction  was  held  in  2008  for  ownership  of  the  teams  for  10  years,  with  a base price of USD 50 million. The franchises acquire players through an English auction that is con- ducted every year. However, there are several rules imposed by the IPL. For example, only international  players and popular Indian players are auctioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of the players could be measured through several metrics. Although the IPL fol- lows the Twenty20 format of the game, it is possible that the performance of the players in the other formats of the game such as Test and One-Day matches could influence player pricing. A few players had excellent records in Test matches, but their records in Twenty20 matches were not very impressive. The performances of 130 players who played in at least one season of the IPL (2008−2011) measured through various performance metrics \n",
